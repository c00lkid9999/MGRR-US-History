    <p>Martin Luther King Jr. was born on January 15, 1929. He graduated from Morehouse College with honors and earned his doctorate from Boston University. In Boston, he married Coretta Scott and had two daughters and two sons. He became a pastor in Montgomery in 1954.</p>
    <p>King decided to get involved in civil rights, joining the NAACP. When Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger, King led a bus boycott that lasted for over a year. Despite racial violence against him, King continued to be an incredibly important leader in civil rights.</p>
    <p>King’s most famous speech was his “I Have a Dream” speech, given at the famous March on Washington to over 250,000 people. King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work at the age of 35, and donated the prize money to keep fighting for civil rights.</p>
    <p>Sadly, on Thursday April 4, 1968, at 6:05 PM, Martin Luther King was assassinated on a balcony outside of his room at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis Tennessee by James Earl Ray. He was 39 years old. His death instantly sparked racial violence nationwide, resulting in more than 40 deaths. On April 7, a national day of mourning was observed, and over 100,000 mourners joined in a funeral service for him a few days later. King will forever be remembered as one of the greatest civil rights leaders of the era.</p>
