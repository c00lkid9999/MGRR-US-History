    <h2>Submission 9: Cuban Missile Crisis News Anchor Script</h2>
    <p>10/28/1962</p>
<p>ANCHOR: Breaking news: Today, the Cuban Missile Crisis, which we have all been closely following, ended after Soviet leader Khrushchev conceded from the conflict and removed the Soviet missiles from Cuba.</p>
<p>This terrifying event started a mere 14 days ago, when a U.S. U-2 spy plane, piloted by Major Richard Heyser, took photos of newly built installations in the Cuban countryside. The very next day, CIA analysts spotted launchers, missiles, and transport trucks in those photos. This indicated that the Soviets were building sites to launch missiles at targets all across our country.</p>
<p>President Kennedy quickly met with his advisers to discuss how to respond to this threat. They all offered varying opinions, and Kennedy decided against attacking Cuba and opted to call a quarantine in the attempt to negotiate a withdrawal.</p>
<p>If you recall his television speech on our network on October 22nd, JFK revealed the evidence of this threat and announced that the United States would enact the previously mentioned quarantine, preventing ships with weapons from reaching Cuba and demanding the Soviets to withdraw their missiles. Throughout the next few days, we waited for news of the negotiations as the world leaders communicated.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, you will remember that a different U-2 pilot than the one that took the photos was shot down and killed over Cuba. This put the conflict into a whole new perspective, as the Soviets had potentially fired the first shot in a nuclear war. This led both leaders to realize that the situation was out of control, and the United States revealed that they would also remove their missiles from Turkey.</p>
<p>Today, peace was reached and the missiles will quickly be removed from Cuba. This event will be remembered in history as a near miss to nuclear war, and our country and our president’s solid stance in the face of outright Soviet aggression.</p>
