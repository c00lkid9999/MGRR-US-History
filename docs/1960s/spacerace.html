    <p>Origin: This clip is footage of the Apollo 11 landing on the moon in 1969. This was a monumental moment in US history, and it culminated the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
    <p>Purpose: This footage was taken to broadcast and track the landing on the moon in order to present it to the public. The moon landing was an important social event as well as a political one, and its broadcast allowed the public to connect with it in a special way.</p>
    <p>Content: This clip first shows one of the Apollo 11 at the bottom of the ladder of the lunar lander, talking about his observations of the surface of the moon. They then prepare to plant the flag, and both leave to plant the flag on the moon. The clip features dialogue between the astronauts and those on Earth as the astronauts make observations and plant the flag.</p>
    <p>Value: This clip has incredible value. We can see original footage and audio of the moon landing, allowing us to experience it in a special way, different from text-based mediums. It shows how important the moon landing was at the time and how it still is today.</p>
    <p>Limitations: Despite the extraordinary nature of this clip, it is strongly limited by the poor video and audio quality. I found it difficult to tell exactly what everyone in the video was saying, and the black and white nature of the clip makes it hard to see everything that is going on very well.</p>
