    <p>The 1970s were very important in the development of computers and their integration into society. In the 1960s, computers had started to enter businesses, industries, and trade, and this movement continued to gather momentum in the 1970s. This was due to the leap forward in microelectronics, leading to enormous increases in performance. Additionally, the 1970s resulted in many mini and micro computers travelling into the business world. In factories, computers were used to control and automate manufacturing processes, leading to 20% to 26% of factory workers being replaced by the 1980s. Some of the most important events in computing in this decade happened in the second half, including the release of the Apple II computer, Atari’s first video game console, and the release of the classic video game Pong. In all, many important events in the development of computers occurred in the 1970s, which led to even more important events occurring in the 1960s.<br><br></p>

    <p><strong>Origin</strong>: The Apple II was a microcomputer series created by Apple Computer, Inc. from 1977 to 1993. The original model was designed by Steve Wozniak and first sold on June 10, 1977. It was the successor to Apple Computer, Inc.’s first computer, the Apple I, and expanded on many of its features. Other computers in the Apple II family contain the Apple II Plus, the Apple IIe, the Apple IIc, and the Apple IIc Plus. It is often stylized as “Apple ][”.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The Apple II was created by its company to make the original creators of it money, of course. It succeeded in doing so as it was very popular. The computer sold 6 million units in all of its models, with a peak of 1 million sold in 1983. Additionally, Apple as a company was created to help make computers that people could have in their homes or offices, and the small size of the Apple II made that a reality.</p>
<p><strong>Content</strong>: The Apple II was sold as a finished consumer appliance rather than a kit, unlike its predecessor microcomputers. All computers in the series share similar design elements: a plastic case, a built-in keyboard, color graphics, sound capabilities, and a built-in programming language, BASIC. Their motherboard holds eight expansion slots and 48 kb of RAM. An enormous amount of software was also created for the computers. The popular release of the VisiCalc spreadsheet made the computer especially popular.</p>
<p><strong>Value</strong>: The Apple II is a great example of a 1970s computer. Additionally, it had an enormous impact on the technology industry, expanding the roles of microcomputers in society. This was the first personal computer that many ever had. By looking at this computer, we can see what computers used to look like at the time, specifically microcomputers. Additionally, by looking at the interior hardware, we can understand how computers worked in the 1970s</p>
<p><strong>Limitations</strong>: The Apple II is not fully representative of the computers of the 1970s. As a microcomputer, it is quite different from many of the other computers from the same decade, and is stylistically and functionally different from other computers. Additionally, there is an incredible amount of stuff to study with the Apple II, meaning that it may be a good idea to study just some software or hardware for it. It would also be a good idea to study other different types of computers from the same decade.</p>
