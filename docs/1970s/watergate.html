<h2>Submission 4: Mini Essay on Watergate</h2>
<div class="infobox" style="margin: auto; display: block; text-align: center;"><img width="512" alt="Watergate complex 2006 aerial view" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/WatergateFromAir.JPG/512px-WatergateFromAir.JPG?20080813012826"></div>
<p>Watergate was a major event in the decade of the 1970s. It was the first and only time that a president has resigned in all of United States history, a dramatic culmination to a series of scandals that shocked the nation. Because of its impact on social life and the high-level base of its impact, Watergate was the most important political event of the 1970s.
    Firstly, Watergate had a huge impact on social life. Initially, election survey data in 1972, before Watergate, showed that Nixon best reflected moral standards more than other candidates, and 74.5% of respondents believed him to be a trustworthy president. However, the events of Watergate upturned society. Many people, especially former voters for Nixon, were less trusting of people and politicians after the events of Watergate, and trust in the press dropped for Nixon voters while being raised for McGovern voters, with the reverse happening for television media. This shows how Watergate opened rifts in society due to political disagreements, meaning that it had a major social impact.
    Second, Watergate had a huge impact due to the incredibly high-level nature of the scandal. At times, the scandal led people to believe democracy as a whole was at stake, not just Nixon as the president, especially in cases such as the “Saturday Night Massacre,” where Nixon fired many top leaders while trying to find someone who would fire the prosecutor against him. This shows how the political impact of Watergate was high, as people were worried that United States democracy would not be able to withstand it.
    In all, Watergate was an important political event, and it had many impacts. Because of those impacts on social life and the high-level nature of the scandal, Watergate was the most important political event of the 1970s.
