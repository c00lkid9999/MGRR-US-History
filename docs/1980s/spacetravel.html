    <p>On January 28, 1989, the Challenger Space Shuttle burst into flames a mere 73 seconds into the flight, killing all seven of its crew members, including high school teacher Christa McAuliffe, the first non-astronaut citizen to be launched into space. This was the worst space disaster ever.</p>
    <p>The flaws in the Challenger that caused it to explode were due to the rubber O-ring seals of the shuttleâ€™s right-hand solid rocket booster. The rings were vulnerable to cold temperatures, and frost had made the O-ring brittle the night before the launch. Through a crack in the O-ring, hot gas was able to escape, piercing the main fuel tank and causing the liquid hydrogen and oxygen to mix. This caused a massive explosion, destroying the shuttle instantly.</p>
    <p>This event exposed glaring safety flaws in the Challenger spacecraft that would have been easily fixable through a better safety reporting system and pre-launch warnings. Before the final shuttle flight, NASA invested billions of dollars in safety, making many changes, the most notable of which were more safety on the solid rocket boosters and a rudimentary escape system. Due to these safety changes, the next space shuttle, Endeavor, launched successfully after being delayed due to safety inspections.</p>
