    <h2>Submission 15: Celebration of CDs: Famous rock artists of the 1980s</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
          <p><strong>U2</strong>
          </p>
      </li>
  </ol>
  <p>U2 is one of my all time favorite bands. Formed in Dublin in 1976, the band is formed of Bono on lead vocals, the Edge on lead guitar and keyboards, Adam Clayton on bass, and Larry Mullen Jr. on percussion. They released their first four albums in the 1980s: Boy, October, War, and The Joshua Tree. U2’s music of this time was punk-influenced alternative rock, and the group was associated with the post-punk movement. Later in the decade, their work took on a more abstract, ambient sound. Their musical style has continued to evolve and they are a band to this very day.</p>
  <ol start="2">
      <li>
          <p><strong>Queen</strong>
          </p>
      </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The band Queen was formed in London in 1970 by Freddie Mercury on lead vocals and piano, Brian May on guitar and vocals, Roger Taylor on drums and vocals, and later John Deacon on bass. Their early music was influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but they eventually moved into more conventional works featuring styles such as arena rock and pop rock. In the 1980s, they were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. In this decade, they released their compilation album Greatest Hits, which is the best-selling album in the UK and is certified 9x platinum. Sadly, in 1987 Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS and passed away with a complication in 1991.</p>
  <ol start="3">
      <li>
          <p><strong>Journey</strong>
          </p>
      </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Journey was formed in San Francisco in 1973 by former members of various bands: Santana, the Steve Miller Band, and Frumious Bandersnatch. They have had numerous members throughout their history. In the 1980s, their biggest success as a band was “Don’t Stop Believin,’” one of the great songs of the 20th century. Their most successful album was also released during this time.</p>
  <ol start="4">
      <li>
          <p><strong>Bon Jovi</strong>
          </p>
      </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Bon Jovi was formed in Sayreville, New Jersey in 1983. The band consists of singer Jon Bon Jovi, keyboardist David Bryan, drummer Tico Torres, guitarists John Shanks and Phil X, percussionist Everett Bradley, and bassist Hugh McDonald. Their third album, Slippery When Wet, included three Top 10 singles on the Billboard Hot 100, two of which reached the number one position. Their musical style is a mixture of hard rock, arena rock, and pop rock.</p>
  <ol start="5">
      <li>
          <p><strong>Metallica</strong>
          </p>
      </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Metallica was formed in Los Angeles in 1981 by vocalist and guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and was based in San Francisco. Their third album, Master of Puppets, was released in 1986 and is often cited as the band’s best work. Their style of fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship means that they are often cited as one of the founding “big four” bands of thrash metal.</p>
  <div class="infobox"><p>The compact disc’s first prototype was revealed in 1979, and a year later, electronics companies Philips and Sony began working together to create CDs for the public. They decided upon a format which still exists today - shiny, circular storage discs which could hold music and be put into a player to play the music out loud. They were released to the public in 1982 and quickly replaced vinyl and cassette tapes as the best way of storing music. Even though they were larger than cassette tapes, CDs became more popular as you could skip directly to the song you wanted to listen to. By 2007, over 200 billion CDs had been bought and sold around the world. Today, phones have taken over as the primary music storage method, but the legacy of CDs still lives on.</p></div>
  <h2>Submission 16: Guide to the TCP/IP Protocol</h2>
  <p>TCP/IP is one of the most commonly used internet protocols today, and it is the backbone of the internet and modern networking. It enables data transfer and communication across the internet and other networks. After its release in 1960, the TCP/IP protocol suite has continued to evolve, always meeting the modern standards.</p>
<p>The precursor to the internet and TCP/IP was ARPANET, the world’s first operational packet-switching network. TCP/IP was created when Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, in the early 1970s, decided to design a new protocol to overcome the limitations of ARPANET's communication protocol. Its formal introduction came in the 1970s, and in 1983, ARPANET officially adopted TCP/IP. Since then, TCP/IP has evolved, with the exponential growth of its usage and the invention of IPv6 to facilitate an even larger and more secure internet.</p>
<p>But how does TCP/IP work? It consists of two protocols: TCP, which defines how applications create channels of communication across a network and manages the assembly of messages into smaller packets for transmission, and IP, which delivers packets of data across different devices. Other components are also used, such as HTTP for communication with web servers and FTP for file transfers.</p>
<p>TCP/IP uses data packets to transmit data. Each packet consists of three main components: the header, which contains metadata such as source and destination addresses, the payload, which is the actual content of the packet, and the footer, which helps verify data integrity during transmission. The model consists of four layers: the Network Access layers, managing physical connection between devices, the Internet Layer, ensuring the packets are sent to the correct destination, the Transport Layer, which divides large amounts of data into packets and reassembles them at their destination, and the Application Layer, which directly interacts with the software applications and end users.</p>
<p>All of these working together allow you to experience the internet! When a sender transmits data, it passes through all of the layers, with the application layer sending data, the TCP protocol splitting it and routing it, the IP protocol checking destinations, and the Access Layer making sure devices are connected. When data is received, the protocol processes it in the reverse order making sure it is properly reassembled and ready to go!</p>
