    <h2>Submission 13: Top 10 Arcade Games</h2>
    <p>Pac-Man (1)</p>
<p>Pac-Man was created by programmer Toru Iwatnini in 1980 as an alternative to the many more violent arcade games being released at the time. It was released by Namco in Japan and Midway in the United States. The game features a yellow character named Pac-Man being controlled by the player moving around the screen to consume dots and avoid the four colored ghosts. Pac-Man can obtain “power pellets” at the corner of each level, allowing Pac-Man to attack the ghosts. Bonus objects, usually fruit, also appear occasionally for additional points. The game ends when Pac-Man loses all of his lives. This game was an instant hit in the United States - in 1982, an estimated 30 million Americans spent $8 million a week playing Pac-Man. Within a year, spin-offs such as Ms. Pac-Man was appearing. I ranked Pac-Man number 1 on this list because of its timelessness and popularity in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Galaga (2)</p>
<p>Galaga was released in 1981 by Namco as the sequel to one of their previous games, Galaxian, which appears at number 10 on this list. Galaga improves on the space shooter arcade format featured in Space Invaders and Galaxian by adding the ability for the ship to be captured but then regained, allowing for the ship to shoot multiple bullets at a time, and awarding bonus points for clearing stages. Galaga has spawned several sequels made by Namco and has become a famous arcade game in 1980s pop culture and today. Personally, Galaga is one of my favorite arcade games to play, which is why I ranked it at number 2 on this list.</p>
<p>Mario Bros (3)</p>
<p>While Super Mario Bros. was originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985, a version of it was created and released for international arcades on the Nintendo VS. System in 1986. In this game, players control Mario or Luigi, traversing the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue Princess Toadstool from Bowser. This video game is frequently referred to as one of the greatest video games of all time, and is one of the best selling video games of all time. It has given way to an incredible amount of sequels, and helped to popularize the side-scrolling platformer genre. This game and its sequels are some of my favorites to play today, and are ubiquitous in video game history.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong (4)</p>
<p>Donkey Kong was created by Sjigeru Miyamoto in 1981. It featured Jumpman (later Mario) attempting to rescue his girlfriend Pauline from Donkey Kong, who throws barrels to stop him. This game was a hit in arcades when it was released, and quickly spawned numerous arcade sequels, including Donkey Kong Jr. and Donkey Kong 3, featuring the characters. Nintendo then moved the franchise to consoles, releasing many titles. This series continues today. I have not played the Donkey Kong video games very much, but they are an interesting arcade classic.</p>
<p>Frogger (5)</p>
<p>Frogger was developed by Konami in 1981. It features the very simple idea of a frog crossing a road and a river to get to safety, avoiding cars, falling into the water, and other dangers. Frogger was one of the best selling games on Atari’s classic 2600 console when it made the jump to home games as well. Frogger has been positively received as one of the greatest video games ever made, and by 2005, 20 million copies had been sold worldwide. In my opinion, Frogger has incredibly simple gameplay which makes it an amazing game, especially as an arcade game.</p>
<p>Space Invaders (6)</p>
<p>Space Invaders was designed by Tomohiro Hishikado and released in Japan in 1978. It was a space-themed game featuring a laser cannon used to shoot the gradually advancing space creatures. It was one of the first arcade games to feature a high score. This game drove onwards a craze for arcade games, first in Japan and then elsewhere, including the United States. It also entered the home market as the Atari 2600’s most popular game. It remains today as the most popular title of Taito, and its pixelated creatures are one of the most recognizable symbols in video games.</p>
<p>Asteroids (7)</p>
<p>Asteroids was originally designed by Lyle Raines, Atari’s vice president of engineering. It was programmed by Ed Logg. The game’s concept was to shoot asteroids, breaking them into smaller asteroids to shoot again. The asteroids get faster every time they are broken, creating a challenge for the player avoiding debris. When it was released, it was very popular and replaced Space Invaders as the most prominent arcade game. It made enough money for Atari to break off and become its own, financially independent company.</p>
<p>Punch-Out!! (8)</p>
<p>Punch-Out!! Was released in 1984 by Nintendo, and was quickly followed by a console version in 1987 for the NES. This game features Little Mac climbing the rankings of the World Video Boxing Association and fighting against other boxers around the world. It became a major Nintendo series, but it never gained the level of popularity of other Nintendo titles such as Super Mario Bros.</p>
<p>Pong (9)</p>
<p>Pong is an incredibly simple game, featuring just two paddles and a ball. However, it was incredibly influential, introducing the world to video games. Pong was developed in 1972 and initially released as an arcade machine, and it was an instant hit, leading Atari to have tens of thousands of copies of the game all over the country. In 1975, they released a home version of the game, leading to it being even more successful. Although its gameplay is very simple, Pong introduced the world to video games, which is why I am putting it at place 9 on this list.</p>
<p>Galaxian (10)</p>
<p>Galaxian built on the original format of Space Invaders, but with full-color graphics and no barriers. It was important in video game history as it had a revolutionary new way of running. Instead of drawing the screen as just one thing, individual sprites were given dedicated places in the circuit, allowing them to be drawn without completely resetting the screen. Additionally, Galaxian sprites could hold up to four different colors. This allowed video games to be more detailed and interesting than ever before.</p>
<h2>Submission 14: OPCVL on Super Mario Bros.</h2>
<p><strong>Origin</strong>: Super Mario Bros. was made by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka, with music by Koji Kondo, for the company Nintendo. It was released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and also on arcade systems, first in Japan, then in North America. It was released in 1985, following the video game industry crash of 1983, and helped to revive the industry. It was not Nintendo’s first game, but it was one of their first major successes.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Like the other games of Nintendo, Super Mario Bros was released with the primary intention of making the company money and providing entertainment to fans. This clearly paid off, as today 430 million copies of Super Mario franchise games have been sold worldwide, which makes it the sixth-bestselling video game series (behind the larger Mario franchine, Tetris, Call of Duty, Pokémon, and Grand Theft Auto).</p>
<p><strong>Content</strong>: Super Mario Bros. features a somewhat strange storyline. Princess Toadstool has been kidnapped by a giant turtle-like creature named Boswer and Mario (along with Luigi in multiplayer mode) must traverse the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue her. The game is in the platformer genre, as Mario progresses through side-scrolling levels and defeats enemies to reach his goal. The world is divided into levels, which must be exited before the time limit finishes. Finally, Mario has a finite number of lives and must complete the game before they run out.
    <br><strong>Value</strong>: On the surface, a simple video game such as this one does not seem to have much value as a primary source. However, it shows many things. First of all, the content of the game shows what video game graphics looked like at the time, along with stylistic design choices of the gameplay. Secondly, the actual hardware of the game cartridges, the NES console, and the arcade machines that Super Mario Bros. was able to run on show how video games were created at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations</strong>: This source is only one video game of the time, created by one company, and therefore only reflects some aspect of the growing video game world. Many other companies existed, making completely different kinds of games, for various mediums. To gain a full picture of how video games looked and functioned, it is crucial to look at a variety of games created by different companies both for consoles and for arcades.</p>
